# ⚡ BetaVolt — Unified Agentic Smart Metering Super App

> **"We didn't build another energy app. We built a brain for your home."**

BetaVolt is an AI-powered smart metering super app that autonomously monitors, controls, and optimizes home energy consumption in real time. Built for the INSTINCT 4.0 Hackathon by **Team ADROIT SDVC**.

## 🧠 What is BetaVolt?

BetaVolt is not a monitoring dashboard — it's an intelligent agent that **thinks, decides, and acts** on your behalf. It builds a live digital twin of your home, watches tariffs every second, and autonomously controls your appliances before your bill spikes. When a high-impact decision needs human approval, it **calls you**, explains the situation, and waits for your go-ahead — like JARVIS.
